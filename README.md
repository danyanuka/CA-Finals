# Trillo (Front-end)

## description-

This project served as the culmination of our efforts during the finals of the Coding-Academy Bootcamp. Developed over approximately a month and a half by me and two teamates, it is a full-stack (MERN) application created from scratch. Our objective was to replicate the functionality of a well-established application, and we chose to replicate Trello.
For those who are not familliar with Trello, it is a tool for managing teamwork projects. in short, it allows users to create an enviorment where they can track their projects when working in a team.
